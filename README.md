🌿 Leaf Disease Detection using Python and Machine Learning
This project implements a machine learning-based system to detect and classify plant leaf diseases from images. Leveraging image processing techniques and supervised learning models, the system can accurately identify common diseases in plants such as tomato, potato, and grape leaves.

🔍 Features
Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation)
Disease classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Support for multiple plant types and disease categories
Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
Interactive prediction on custom leaf images

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV)
Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization

📁 Dataset
Used the PlantVillage Dataset from Kaggle, containing over 50,000 labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository
Install dependencies from requirements.txt
Run leaf_disease_detection.ipynb to train and test the model
Use predict.py to test with your own images

📊 Results
Achieved over 95% accuracy on the validation set, demonstrating strong potential for real-world application in smart agriculture.
